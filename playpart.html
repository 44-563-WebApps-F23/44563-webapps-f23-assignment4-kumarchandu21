<h4 class="HELMER">HELMER.</h4>
<p class="speech">Is it my little squirrel bustling about?</p>

<h4 class="NORA">NORA.</h4>
<p class="speech">Yes!</p>

<h4 class="HELMER">HELMER.</h4>
<p class="speech"> did my squirrel come home?</p>

<h4 class="NORA">NORA.</h4>
<p class="speech">Just now.</p> <p class="direction">_[Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and wipes her
mouth.]_</p> <p class="speech">Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.</p>

<h4 class="HELMER">HELMER.</h4>
<p class="speech">Don't disturb me.</p> <p class="direction">_[A little later, he opens the door and looks into
the room, pen in hand.]_</p> <p class="speech">Bought, did you say? All these things? Has my
little spendthrift been wasting money again?</p>

<h4 class="NORA">NORA.</h4>
<p class="speech">Yes but, Torvald, this year we really can let ourselves go a little.
This is the first Christmas that we have not needed to economise.</p>

<h4 class="HELMER">HELMER.</h4>
<p class="speech"> Still, you know, we can't spend money recklessly.</p>

<h4 class="NORA">NORA.</h4>
<p class="speech">Yes, Torvald, we may be a wee bit more reckless now, mayn't we? Just a
tiny wee bit! You are going to have a big salary and earn lots and lots
of money.</p>

<h4 class="HELMER">HELMER.</h4>
<p class="speech">Yes, after the New Year; but then it will be a whole quarter before the
salary is due.</p>
